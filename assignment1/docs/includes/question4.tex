\section{Question}

\textit{Now look at the following database:
http://www.kazusa.or.jp/codon/
The codon usage database lists the frequency which each codon is used in a species (different species prefer different codons). Sequences which have too many rarer codons result in slowing down transcription and inhibition of protein expression - in extreme cases, rare codons are thought to introduce transcription errors when the rare tRNA is not available. If you were to try and express your human cDNA sequence in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), which codons in your sequence might cause problems for expression. Note there is no hard threshold, but generally codons with 1\% usage or less are considered rare.}
