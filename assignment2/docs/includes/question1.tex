% - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

\subsection{Compare your result with a query for homologues, to find these, select 'HomoloGene' in NCBI instead of 'Gene' as search option.}

% - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

\subsection{How well do the results match when you consider e-value, \% overlap or score from your BLAST search?}

% - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

\subsection{List those results from your initial query that you think are true orthologues, and explain why.}
