\section{Question}

\subsection{Now consider the phylogenetic implications of your results. First, create a BLAST tree (using the function 'Distance tree of results').}

% - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

\subsection{Describe the result and its relevance.}

% - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

\subsection{How can this be used to study the disease in another model organism?}

% - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

\subsection{Are there known orthologues in mouse, fruit fly or yeast?}

% - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

\subsection{Using the information under 'General gene information', discuss whether mouse, fruit fly or yeast (or any of these for which an orthologue exists) are suitable models to study the disease.}

\textbf{Note: To give an example, if the gene is implicated in cell cycle, yeast may well be a good model because it is easier to study than mice. But if the gene is relevant for brain function, yeast may of course be less relevant even if an orthologue exists.}
